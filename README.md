# I am so cold!

*This site is an academic exercise with little practical application.*

## The requirements:
1. I am tired of this cold weather, where is the closest place I can go that is at least 72ยบ, and how do I get there?
2. Use Forecast.io and Leaflet APIs.

A user enters their origin latitude, longitude, and the temperature they desire. When they click the "Find warm place" button, "places.json" is parsed and the distance in miles to each "place" is calculated and pushed into an array, after which the array is sorted by distance.

Beginning with the closest place, the site requests current weather information from Forecast.io. The result is checked to see if the maximum daily temperature is greater than the desired temperature. If not, the next place is checked. When the place's temperature is greater to or equal than the desired temperature, a route from the origin location to the destination is drawn on a map using the Leaflet API.

The checked places that have temperatures below desired are listed for the convenience of the user, with relevant distance and temperature information.

## Possible future enhancements

1. Map pin would show the place's temperature and a popup might display the name of the place.
2. Input field would be geocode enabled so the user wouldn't have to use esoteric latitude and longitude values.
3. Form validation for acceptable values, not just numbers.
5. Select list for the temperature field.
